		As a child you would wait <br>
		And watch from far away <br>
		But you always knew that you'd be the one <br>
		That work while they all play <br>
	</span>
	<br>
	<span>
		In youth you'd lay <br>
		Awake at night and scheme <br>
		Of all the things that you would change <br>
		But it was just a dream! <br>

		Here we are, don't turn away now, <br>
		We are the warriors that built this town <br>
		Here we are, don't turn away now <br>
		We are the warriors that built this town <br>
		From dust.
